# RallySportED
RallySportED is a set of tools for modding the cult 1996 DOS game Rally-Sport.

The tools grant you the following powers:
- Create new tracks
- Modify existing tracks
- Edit textures
- Edit the AI

They're available for a variety of platforms:
- DOS
- Linux
- Windows (95 through 10)
- Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and no doubt others)

At the moment, RallySportED provides exclusive support for the demo version of Rally-Sport, which you can find online and also bundled with the binary distributions of RallySportED. The full commercial release of the game is not supported, at this time (generally speaking, the commercial release adds a couple of tracks, fixes a few bugs, and introduces split-screen support, but is otherwise the same as the demo version).
