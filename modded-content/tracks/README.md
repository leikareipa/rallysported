# Fresh new tracks for Rally-Sport
This repo provides a mirror of (some of the) new modded tracks that've been made for the DOS game Rally-Sport using the awesome third-party asset editor RallySportED.

The [files/](files/) directory contains the actual track data, each track in its own zip file that also comes with instructions on how to play that track in Rally-Sport. You'll note though that the file names aren't particularly transparent (e.g. `2kf29k.zip`). This is because, for technical reasons, each track is assigned an id (e.g. `2kf29k`), from which its file name derives also.

For convenience, I've provided `index.php`, which generates a more user-accessible HTML page listing the tracks, along with their actual names and other relevant info. You can find a live version of that page [here](http://www.tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/rallysported/tracklist/).

## Asset symbiosis with RallySportED
The page generated by `index.php` includes for each track a link to open a copy of the track in the [web version of RallySportED](https://github.com/leikareipa/rallysported-js) (live [here](http://www.tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/rallysported/)), for direct viewing, editing, etc. This feature doesn't access the track files provided in the repo, here, but rather ones stored alongside whichever server the web version of RallySportED is running on.

If you want to set up a similar system locally or otherwise, you'll want to place the track files from [files/](files/) in this repo into a folder relative to RallySportED like so: `/tracklist/files/xxxx.zip`. RallySportED can then be accessed with the URL parameter `?track=xxxx` to load that track file.
